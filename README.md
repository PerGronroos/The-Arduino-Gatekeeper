# The-Arduino-Gatekeeper
Code repo for Arduino Maker Challenge

The ArduinoCode folder contains the multiple-tab Arduino sketch written for the Arduino Mega 2560. While each file is a  *.ino, each one is a tab in the Arduino IDE. This helps keep the code organized in separate sections.

The src folder contains the modified VirtualShield library (*.cpp and *.h) which uses the Serial1 port on the Mega 2560.

Please refer to https://www.hackster.io/challenges/arduino-microsoft-maker for the usage details.
